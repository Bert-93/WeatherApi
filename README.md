# WeatherApi

These is a simple weather API that provides current weather data for any location. It supports multiple languages and units of measurement.
Was made with C# and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Goal:
# - Provide a simple and easy-to-use weather API
# - Refresh concepts that I learned in C# time ago
# - Have an easy API to review and use in the future the structure
